=== Archetype for Genesis ===

This, my friends, is a work in progress.

=== Installation Instructions ===

1. Upload the Archetype for Genesis theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the Archetype for Genesis theme.
4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.
